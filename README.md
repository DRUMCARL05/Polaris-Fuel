## About Polaris Fuel

Polaris Fuel is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize resource trading in the Star Atlas universe. Our platform serves as a wholesale marketplace, connecting major resource providers with bulk buyers to streamline large-scale operations within the game's economy. 

Notably, the Polaris Fuel dApp is coded entirely from scratch on the Solana network and operates independently from the official Star Atlas marketplace. This custom-built approach allows us to offer specialized features tailored specifically for wholesale trading, while maintaining the security and efficiency of the Solana blockchain.
